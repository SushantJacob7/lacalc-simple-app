# lacalc-simple-app
A very simple app. But good to get your feet wet if it is the first react native app you ever played with.

The app uses expo as framework to run react native.<br>
Here are the steps:<br>
1, install docker on your computer<br>
2, git clone from this repo<br>
3, run ./dev_container.sh<br>
4, cd larn2/ <br>
5, expo start<br>
<You have app being served from your computer>
